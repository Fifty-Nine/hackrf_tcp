# Introduction

A quick I/Q spectrum server for HackRF. This will allow you to control your HackRF and stream data from it over the network using TCP.

hackrf_tcp was coded in a rush just as a PoC and uploaded to github for the record. It will be abandoned in favour of osmorsdr_tcp which will work with any SDR supported by gr-osmosdr.

Right now the only way to connect/use hackrf_tcp is through a custom source block for gr-osmosdr which can be found at https://github.com/jpenalbae/gr-osmosdr_hackrftcp
